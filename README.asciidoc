Pacrepo ReadMe
==============

Manage a custom pacman repository.

Overview
--------

Pacrepo is used to add and remove packages from a custom pacman repository.

Install
-------

Pacrepo can be installed from the AUR.

Configure
---------

The config file is at +/etc/pacrepo.conf+. The most important option in this
file is +CONFIG+, which defines a pacman configuration file which has your
custom repository defined in it. This repo must be configured *last* in the
file.

You can define the following options within it:

CONFIG::
	The pacman configuration file which has your custom repository defined in
	it. This repo must be configured *last* in the file.

HOST:: 
	The host that repository lives on. In most cases, this will be the
	host in the +Server+ portion of the repository defined in +CONFIG+.

REPO::
	The path to the repository on +HOST+.

If +HOST+ is left blank, pacrepo will assume the repository lives on the local
host and copy files directly to the +REPO+ directory. Otherwise, it will use
multiple invocations of `ssh` and `scp` to manipulate the repository, so you
will probably want to use something like ssh-agent or GSSAPI authentication to
avoid entering your password multiple times.
