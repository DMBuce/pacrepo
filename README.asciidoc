Pacrepo ReadMe
==============

Collection of pacman-related tools.

Overview
--------

This project includes the following tools:

* pacrepo: Run pacman against a single repo
* addpkg: Add a package to a repo
* rmpkg: Remove a package from a repo
* pacpatch: Patches config files after pacman update

Install
-------

Pacrepo can be installed from the AUR.

Configure
---------

The config file is at +/etc/pacrepo.conf+. You can define the following
options within it:

**REPOS**=( name=[host:]/path ... )::
	A list of repositories for +addpkg+ and +rmpkg+ to manage. 'name' is the
	name of the repository in +CONFIG+, '/path' is the full path to the
	repository on the filesystem, and 'host' (optional) is the ip address or
	host name of the system the repository lives on.
+
When a repository is configured with a 'host', +addpkg+ and +rmpkg+ will use
multiple invocations of `ssh` and `scp` to manipulate the repository, so you
will probably want to use something like ssh-agent or GSSAPI authentication to
avoid entering your password multiple times.
+
Default: +REPOS=()+

**REPO**=<repo>::
	The repository that +addpkg+, +rmpkg+, and +pacrepo+ should use by
	default.
+
Default: +REPO=custom+

**CONFIG**=/path/to/pacman.conf::
	The path to the configuration file containing the options and repositories
	that +pacrepo+ should use.
+
Default: +CONFIG=/etc/pacman.conf+
